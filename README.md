`Annowiwito` is the _An_droid _no_ _wi_dget _Wi_Fi _to_ggler.

It's a minimalist app that toggles the current WiFi state. It is not, as the
name says, a widget (i.e. it doesn't display the current state - but don't
worry, there are dozens of widgets out there that do that for you), but an app
that toggles the WiFi state upon start and exits immediately. It's meant to be
used like a script and may be useful in combination with a customizable
lockscreen like [WidgetLocker][] that allows you to directly execute
applications.

The launcher icons are provided by the free version of [Iconshock][]'s [Android
Style Set][]. Thx for sharing!
